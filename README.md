# 🛰️ Hyperverse Transfer Protocol (HVTP)

**HVTP** is an open application-layer protocol for the **real-time distribution, synchronization, and interaction of 3D virtual spaces** across heterogeneous systems.

> Designed to bridge virtual environments — not platforms.

HVTP enables **collaborative 3D environments** (CVEs) where users and systems can share, manipulate, and persist scenes using a unified, extensible **scene graph format** based on [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf). It defines a protocol and runtime model that supports **live editing**, **multi-client presence**, and **distributed rendering** across engines, devices, and networks.

---

## ✨ Vision

We aim to create a **free, open, and decentralized system** for connecting spatial computing applications — from game engines to web renderers, from digital twins to simulation platforms.

HVTP is not a game engine. It’s not a platform. It’s a **real-time, interoperable bridge** between any spatial system that supports 3D scenes.

## 🔧 Features (Planned & In Progress)

### ✅ Core Capabilities

* 📡 **Application-layer protocol** (engine-agnostic)
* 🧠 **Shared scene graph model** using glTF
* 🔄 **Real-time updates & delta sync**
* 🔀 **Bi-directional synchronization** of scene changes
* 🌐 **Multi-client collaboration** and session awareness
* 📁 **Platform-neutral asset referencing** (IPFS, CDN, local, etc.)

### 🧱 Extensible Modules

* 🧍 **Identity & Presence** (DID-compatible avatar protocols)
* 🎭 **Avatar support** with glTF/VRM extensions
* 🔐 **Access control & permissioning** per scene or entity
* ⚡ **Scripting & behavior graphs** (planned support for Lua/WASM)
* 🛰️ **Teleportation & routing** between hosted virtual scenes
* 🪞 **Engine bridges** (Unity, Unreal, Godot, Three.js, Python, WebXR)

---

## 📦 Architecture Overview

HVTP follows a **client-server or peer-mesh model**, where each participant maintains a **local scene graph** and exchanges updates through a lightweight, binary or JSON-based messaging layer.

    C[Python Simulation] -->|HVTP Protocol| B
    D[WebXR Frontend] -->|HVTP Protocol| B
    E[glTF Asset Store] --> B
```

* **Scene updates** are diffed and propagated efficiently.
* **Clients** can subscribe to subgraphs or specific entities.
* **Sessions** track who is present, what is visible, and what has changed.

## 🔍 Use Cases

* 🔧 **Collaborative 3D design tools**
* 🎓 **Immersive educational platforms**
* 🏙️ **Digital twins & smart cities**
* 🤝 **Cross-engine multiplayer frameworks**
* 🔬 **Scientific simulations**
* 🚀 **Virtual social or enterprise spaces**

---

## 🤖 AI Agents Integration

HVTP is designed not only for human users but also for **autonomous AI agents** capable of **observing, navigating, interacting with**, and even **modifying** the shared scene.

Modern virtual environments often involve non-human participants:

* 🧠 **NPCs powered by LLMs or behavioral models**
* 🤖 **Bots for QA testing or automated moderation**
* 📡 **Digital twins driven by real-world sensors or APIs**
* 🧑‍🚀 **Cognitive agents exploring and learning in CVEs**

HVTP treats these agents as **first-class participants** in the collaborative space, with their own presence, permissions, and communication channels.
